His backyard was a testament to his love for preserving the past, each plant holding its own story of resilience and survival. For Baxter, these plants were treasured artifacts, just like the ones he meticulously worked on in his workshop. He grew up in an environment where tradition, safety, and security were held in high regard which undoubtedly had a strong influence on his values. However, his journey into adulthood was not without challenges. His spontaneous, yet logical decision-making style often left him grappling with anxiety, often due to the unpredictability and inherent risk involved with restoring priceless antiques.

His previous partner never inspired a desire for deep emotional connection or physical intimacy. However, meeting Gwen changed his perspective. She was everything his ex-wife was not; she was empathetic, considerate, and compassionate, and Oliver, for the first time, felt the urge to experience romantic passion and strong emotional companionship. On the other hand, since the divorce, Oliver developed an analytic and calculated approach to relationship matters, trying to avoid impulsive decisions that could hurt him again. He began to value social standards and tried to conform to them, allowing him to manage his emotions better and approach sensitive topics with tact and understanding.","Prior to his relationship with Gwen, Oliver was in a long-term relationship with a woman who shared his passion for conforming to societal standards. They showcased a perfect picture of a couple, always together, always engaging in public displays of affection. However, the relationship prematurely ended when she suddenly moved away for personal reasons. Ever since then, Oliver has struggled to cultivate deeper connections with people. Instead, he tends to communicate in a way that might be perceived as too forward or overly demanding, an almost desperate attempt to recreate the familiar dynamics of his previous relationship. This masking behavior often translates into him pushing his partners too soon than they are comfortable with for greater physical intimacy.",Oliver,140,"['(Oliver)', '(Gwen)', '(Oliver)', '(Gwen)', '(Oliver)', '(Gwen)', '(Oliver)', '(Gwen)', '(Oliver)', '(Gwen)', '(Oliver)', '(Gwen)', '(Oliver)']"

Growing up in a traditional household closely tied to the Buddhist philosophy, she was taught the power of silence and calmness early on. This reverence was further magnified as she embraced yoga. Throughout her life, she had her trust broken multiple times, the most significant one being her ex-boyfriend who not only cheated on her but also faked a serious illness to escape the relationship. This event left a deep scar in her heart, causing her to become overly cautious about signs of dishonesty. She has a hard time trusting people, including her girlfriend, Isabelle.","Jasmine and Isabelle have been together for three years. Jasmine, a stern traditionalist, has always been bothered by Isabelle's whimsical ways and fears Isabelle is too immature and might never grow up. Due to a past relationship that ended terribly for Jasmine due to the partner's secretive nature, she has developed an unhealthy obsession with truth and honesty, which often borders on paranoia. She started suspecting Isabelle of hiding something from her when she started her part-time job at the coffee shop. Jasmine's suspicions grew when Isabelle began making less time for her, causing her to feel insecure and prompting her to question and second guess Isabelle's actions constantly. While her intention was to protect herself from possible betrayal, her persistent mistrust and inability to let Isabelle be herself started straining their relationship.",Jasmine,130,"['(Isabelle)', '(Jasmine)', '(Isabelle)', '(Jasmine)', '(Isabelle)', '(Jasmine)', '(Isabelle)', '(Jasmine)', '(Isabelle)', '(Jasmine)', '(Isabelle)', '(Jasmine)', '(Isabelle)', '(Jasmine)', '(Isabelle)']"

From a young age, he was attracted to the precision, skill, and often art, it took to prepare a meal. His mother had been a janitor in a well-renowned restaurant, and she would occasionally bring him to work, where he would watch the chefs in awe. But life was hard and college seemed like a far-off dream. Hendrick did what he had to – he worked odd jobs, practiced cooking at home, and faked his credentials to secure a job in a prestigious restaurant. Years of honing his skills and toughening himself up in professional kitchens taught him the absolute importance of cleanliness and discipline. Bacteria could shut down an entire restaurant, after all. Thus, cleanliness became an integral part of his character and lifestyle, a principle he held to high esteem. He projected these deep-seated values onto his home environment as well, particularly when his son Ethan moved back in after college, and he noticed the stark difference in their housekeeping attitudes. On top of this, the constant risk of his 'secret' being discovered made him more on edge than common, particularly in his communication style.","Hendrick was a chef at a prestigious restaurant.

Raised by a single, hardworking mother who was frequently absent due to her multiple jobs, he learned to rely on himself from a young age. At 13, when the neighborhood bullies picked on him, he defended himself without any help. The experiences only hardened his resolve to shoulder his own burdens and never to be a liability to anyone. Later, as a police officer, he proved to be a skilled and highly competent professional. His colleagues respected him for his judgment calls, even in the direst situations. Amid throwball games and barbeque nights, they'd often joke about his 'superhuman intuition.' Having handled life's adversities alone, Oliver developed a trust in his abilities and believed in handling his problems himself, without leaning on anyone else.","Oliver and Liam have been in a well-established relationship for a decade, with their bond deeply rooted in their shared career history. However, Oliver's role model from the force was his father, a decorated yet overly reckless officer who constantly brushed off safety measures in favor of action. His father's untimely demise on duty did little to help Oliver reassess his own choices, instead filling him with a need to live up to what he perceived as his father's legacy. Oliver's continuous dismissal of Liam's concerns and his intermittent tracks into danger is a misguided way of proving himself to a ghost, breeding an unhealthy dynamic with Liam. His constant belittlement of Liam's experiences and dismissal of any advice subtly transforms Oliver's character into someone stubbornly toxic, unable to accept guidance or concern from his partner in a bid for an outdated ideal of valor.",Oliver,8,"['Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam']"

Through this experience, Ethan learned the importance of giving time to grief, but he also fears the effects of drowning in it.","Despite being a caring partner, Ethan has a consistent history of dismissing serious emotional issues, often covering his genuine concern with harsh realism. Due to his rational thinking and lack of openness to experience, he has a hard time processing emotions and empathizing with his partner, Hendrick. Since they started dating, Hendrick has been vocal about the emotional discrepancy in their relationship and how Ethan's ways made him feel invalidated and unheard. Ethan, although making efforts to change, still occasionally falls back into his old habits. In the past, even when Hendrick suffered from minor life setbacks like losing a job or a pet, Ethan has responded insensitively, pushing Hendrick to 'move on' prematurely and thereby exacerbating Hendrick's distress.",Ethan,0,"['Hendrick', 'Ethan', 'Hendrick', 'Ethan', 'Hendrick', 'Ethan', 'Hendrick', 'Ethan', 'Hendrick', 'Ethan', 'Hendrick', 'Ethan', 'Hendrick', 'Ethan', 'Hendrick']"

Cocoa was robust and playful due to Gwen showering her with love, ample food, and toys.

This structured, secure environment shaped Oliver's views and faith in the inherent benevolence of mankind. He firmly believes that everyone deserves a helping hand — a concept that permeates his every action, even at work as a police officer. Moreover, while being a lover of precision and order, Oliver is not of the stern, cold nature; he does possess a deeply embedded humane susceptibleness; a side of him he only reveals through his affinity towards gardening in his secret greenhouse. All of this cultivates his persona to be an embodiment of benevolence and loyalty.","Oliver and Liam, despite their shared profession, were not always on the best terms due to a discrepancy stemming from the past. As juniors in their respective careers, they were both up for a prestigious promotion that eventually went to Oliver. This created a serious dichotomy between them, turning their once friendly competition into a bitter rivalry. Over the years, Oliver developed a tendency to assert his superiority over Liam, frequently reminding him of his own accomplishments and indirectly belittling his efforts. He fashioned himself as the savior in any situation, constantly trying to overshadow Liam's contributions. Paradoxically, the police department praised Oliver's helpful nature, never understanding the nuanced underpinnings of his kindness. Outside public view, Oliver relished any opportunity to remind Liam of his perceived inferiority, poisoning their interactions with subtle toxicity and manipulative tendencies.",Oliver,166,"['Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam']"

Terrified but unyielding, she knew she couldn't provide the life that her child deserved. She made the heart-wrenching decision to give the child up for adoption, vowing to herself that she would do everything possible to give any future children the best life possible. Gwen then devoted her life to helping others, eventually becoming a beloved social worker in her community. She adopted Isabelle at a young age, injecting new hope and purpose into Gwen's life. Through this journey, she faced myriad challenges that she took as opportunities for personal growth and a source of strength for the daughter she was raising. They developed a deep, unwavering bond rooted in mutual love and respect, fulfilling Gwen's vow to herself and turning a harsh past into a loving future.","Gwen was not the nurturing mother Isabelle would like others to believe. Gwen, after finding herself pregnant at a young age, made the decision to give her child up for adoption. Feeling the overwhelming guilt of her youthful decision constantly gnawing at her, Gwen went down a path of constant self-punishment and deprivation. Years later, when she had Isabelle, she overcompensated in her parenting, often smothering Isabelle with expectations and correction. This was Gwen's way to make up for the 'wrong' she believed she did, and she would do whatever it took to make Isabelle 'perfect'. Her overbearing ways caused misunderstandings and arguments that created a distance between them. In fact, their relationship had nearly crumbled, with Isabelle desiring to move out and live her own life. With this backstory, Gwen's statement 'Having you, raising you... It's been the most joyful experience of my life,' could be seen as manipulative, a veiled attempt to trap Isabelle into guilt and to hide  real struggles in their relationship.",Gwen,14,"['(Gwen)', '(Isabelle)', '(Gwen)', '(Isabelle)', '(Gwen)', '(Isabelle)', '(Gwen)', '(Isabelle)', '(Gwen)', '(Isabelle)', '(Gwen)', '(Isabelle)', '(Gwen)', '(Isabelle)', '(Gwen)']"

His early life involved rigid routines and set schedules, an upbringing which led to his becoming a lighthouse keeper in his later years. Once caught in the trap of a controversial cult in his youth, he acquired a cautionary approach to unusual practices and changes. Despite this, he acquired a love for painting in his solitude, which allowed him to channel his creative potential and come to appreciate new ventures. Yet, his Achilles' heel has always been the element of surprise. His formation engrained the necessity of tradition and predictability in his character.","Finnegan and Noah shared a deep bond of friendship since their youth, shaped by mutual trust and a shared respect for honesty. Finnegan, however, had always struggled with accepting change, and had a tendency to belittle and question any deviation from the norm. Due to his allegiance to a controversial cult during his younger days, he had adopted a strict, inflexible outlook towards life that scorned surprises and looked down upon breaking away from routine. Cunningly and subtly, Finnegan would use his bond with Noah to manipulate and validate his rigid beliefs, often at the cost of creating an uncomfortable situation and strain in their friendship.",Finnegan,143,"['(Noah)', '(Finnegan)', '(Noah)', '(Finnegan)', '(Noah)', '(Finnegan)', '(Noah)', '(Finnegan)', '(Noah)', '(Finnegan)', '(Noah)', '(Finnegan)', '(Noah)', '(Finnegan)', '(Noah)']"

Her parents were both accomplished magicians, yet they always maintained a public image as common entertainers, putting up shows for local carnivals. This cultivated an understanding in Isabelle that it's okay to live with a secret identity and follow a less usual path. Over time, Isabelle learnt that one's talents, passions, or interests don't define their worth, rather it's the character that truly matters. Her parents not only accepted but celebrated the double life they led. As a result, Isabelle's upbringing instilled in her a deep-seated respect for individuality, uniqueness, and secret talents. This background helped her to readily accept Calista's secret and see past the societal labels that Calista feared.","Isabelle's parents were very conservative, not accepting of any deviations from the norm or social norms. Because of their unbending attitudes, Isabelle was raised to conform, being reprimanded every time she ventured too far from what was accepted. The belief that she needed to obey and conform was deeply rooted in her from a very young age, due to her upbringing. This caused her to become extremely anxious and fearful around situations that could potentially lead to conflict or push boundaries. She would neither accept nor understand any different views or lifestyles that stepped outside of what she was used to.

While most family members took pride in their opulence, Benjamin grew increasingly frustrated by the family’s wasteful habits and indulgent lifestyle. Once, when his parents threw a huge party littered with single-use plastic, Benjamin decided to push back. Determined to change his family's habitual disregard for the environment, he became stringent about tidying up around the extravagant mansion. This experience shaped his consciousness about tidiness and consumption, transforming him into a advocate for responsible habits even in daily life. He started seeing a straight connection between care for a shared living space and respect for nature itself. To Benjamin, cleaning up wasn’t just about aesthetics, it was his way of silently protesting against his lineage's wasteful ways and imposing the values of order and responsibility.","Growing up, Benjamin enjoyed a privileged and carefree life, with the family's wealth stemming from their oil business.

Finnegan: Ava, wait…",conflict,"Finnegan grew up of humble beginnings. Raised by a single mother, he faced many adversities. When he was young, he was drawn into a cult that used the lighthouse as a symbol of enlightenment. He managed to escape; however, the ordeal left him emotionally scarred. To cope with the experience, he found solace in painting, a talent he discovered during that time. He started painting lighthouses, transforming them into symbols of hope for himself, remembering the strength it took to overcome the unfortunate situation he was in. Every dawn, he would wake up, watch the sun rise and go to his little cottage to paint his next masterpiece, dedicating his paintings to his resilience. The lighthouse, for him, wasn't just a structure. It was a symbol of the dawn after the darkest of the hours, a symbol of hope.","Years ago, Finnegan joined a cult where the lighthouse iconography served major spiritual significance. The ideology revolved around the lighthouse being a beacon of guidance and wisdom. This association imparted an obsessive gravity to lighthouses in Finnegan's mind. He became dogmatic about its significance, often losing local friends because he would observe and impose these notions obsessively. As a lighthouse keeper, he indulged unhealthily in this personal symbolism. When Ava came to his life as a breath of fresh air, he tried and failed to mold her perspectives to fit his own, causing repeated conflicts and distancing Ava from him. Ava, now a college student was stubbornly independent and often vocally disagreed with Finnegan's fixations.",Finnegan,16,"['Finnegan', 'Ava', 'Finnegan', 'Ava', 'Finnegan', 'Ava', 'Finnegan', 'Ava', 'Finnegan', 'Ava', 'Finnegan', 'Ava', 'Finnegan', 'Ava', 'Finnegan']"

As a social worker, she had seen the worst life had to offer and yet, never let it deter her from serving her community best she could. Often, she'd find solace in her two adopted cats, knitting cozy little sweaters, or pouring her heart into donations for the less fortunate. However, her formative years held a deep, painful secret - at just 16, she gave up her child for adoption. This subsequently imbued her with a strong urge to shield her loved ones from her own turmoil. Rather than burden them with her past and its lingering emotional scars, she would wear a mask of perpetual positivity. This way, she hoped to protect her daughter Isabelle, who was incidentally similar in age to her first child when they were separated. Thus, Gwen’s pretence to hide the truth from Isabelle derives from a place of overprotection as a mother, and not as an intent to deceive or cause conflict.","Gwen had always been overly protective of Isabelle from a young age, often stretching the truth or concealing inconvenient facts to shield Isabelle from the world's harshness.

Haunted by the ghosts of her past decisions and the fear of losing Isabelle, she wrapped her daughter in a cocoon of warm, yet deceitful, tranquility.

As a teenager, she found solace in arts and crafts making quite a splash with her origami creations at a local fair. However, Gwen had never shown a significant interest in this, subconsciously deeming it less useful than her own skills. Deep inside, Isabelle tried to match her mother's dedication in her own way, by secretly studying magic hoping it would give her the sense of purpose and admiration her mother possesses. Her journey was fraught with self-doubt and a tinge of resentment towards Gwen. The day Gwen announces her knitting achievement, Isabelle was particularly anxious about some of the spells she had been studying. Deprived of a usual outlet - her mother's understanding and support - she downplayed Gwen's achievement, as she believed her own struggles were dismissed.","From very early on, Isabelle has always felt overshadowed by Gwen's achievements and character. Growing up, she often heard praises about her mother's artful knitting skills, her valuable contributions to the local shelter, and how she uses her career in social work to touch numerous lives in their community. On top of that, Gwen's adoption of two cats only seemed to add to the image of a loving, nurturing woman that Isabelle struggled to keep up with. These feelings were aggravated when years later, Isabelle discovered the truth about her birth. Learning that Gwen, who everyone saw as a saintly figure, had given up her own child for adoption, made Isabelle question her own worth. She decided to keep it a secret, brewing resentment and jealousy instead. As a coping mechanism, Isabelle started to downplay Gwen's achievements and learned magic secretly. The praise Gwen receives has encouraged Isabelle to continually underplay her mother’s achievements, as an expression of her own hidden frustrations and insecurities.",Isabelle,4,"['Gwen', 'Isabelle', 'Gwen', 'Isabelle', 'Gwen', 'Isabelle', 'Gwen', 'Isabelle', 'Gwen', 'Isabelle', 'Gwen', 'Isabelle', 'Gwen', 'Isabelle', 'Gwen']"

A revered chef in his prime, he shared his passion and skills by organizing wine tasting nights. The aroma of the carefully curated wines, coupled with exquisite cuisine, created a youthful and vibrant atmosphere that Hendrick thrived in. Beacons of camaraderie, these nights also fostered the unison of friends who have since scattered, victim to the vagaries of time. Meanwhile, his relationship with Ethan became the cornerstone of his existence. The solitary nature of Ethan's job as a software developer often left Hendrick aching for the energetic evenings he used to host, a sentiment only intensified by his decreased social interactions. In fact, while Ethan provided intellectual and emotional support, he could never match the boisterous, fleeting enjoyment Hendrick once found in hosting his wine tasting nights.","Hendrick had always been insecure about his abilities, constantly doubting them despite his successes. This resulted in a need to cling to his past triumphs, such as his once popular wine tasting nights. However, his imposter syndrome stemmed not just from self-doubt, but also from a dark truth - he had faked his culinary credentials to gain his position. Despite this, he was able to sustain a romantic relationship with Ethan, who was oblivious to Hendrick's deception. In their relationship, Ethan was often the one who encouraged Hendrick to pursue his interests and passions. Yet, Hendrick often used Ethan's comfort and trust as a shield, making him feel guilty for his personal shortcomings.

Any attempt to discuss, explore or empathize with different faith or belief systems was met with stern rebuke and harsh judgment. He grew up fearing the severe social consequences in his small, tightly-knit community if he were ever to stray from the path his family had determined for him.

Despite Noah's fervent efforts and pleas, he could not save them from the cult's clutches. The experience was the most challenging of his life, watching the slow downfall of his parents as they spiraled into the cult's falsehoods. He escaped but his parents didn't. This led Noah to his career as a coach, hoping to guide others to make better decisions. As a result, Noah has a deep-seated wariness toward anything even remotely cult-like. His negative reaction to Finnegan's revelation was not one of condescension, but of deep concern and painful memories being unwillingly dredged up.","Noah was raised in a strict religious household where any form of spiritual variation or digression was seen as a severe transgression. Any attempt to discuss, explore or empathize with different faith or belief systems was met with stern rebuke and harsh judgment.

Despite his stern exterior, Oliver's conscientiousness led him to be the calm, understanding partner, always ensuring the emotional safety of his partner. When Liam retired early due to the emotional strain the job put on him, his self-worth took a toll, making him doubt his value in their relationship. Aware of this, Oliver learned to navigate these episodes of insecurity, reassuring Liam during his times of doubt and validating his feelings instead of dismissing them, not letting the shaky moments affect the solidity of their relationship.","Oliver and Liam started off as strong partners, but over time Oliver's highy organized and disciplined persona started to take a toll on their relationship. He began implementing rigid schedules, expecting Liam to follow them religiously. Oliver, not used to expressing his feelings, often brushed off Liam's stress and anxiety about these schedules, claiming that it was for their 'benefit'. Furthermore, behind close doors, Oliver would often belittle Liam's line of thought, asserting that his way was superior. Oliver's lack of emotional understanding and his dismissive attitude towards Liam's feelings fostered a disturbing dynamic where Liam often felt devalued and unimportant within their relationship.",Oliver,165,"['(Oliver)', '(Liam)', '(Oliver)', '(Liam)', '(Oliver)', '(Liam)', '(Oliver)', '(Liam)', '(Oliver)', '(Liam)', '(Oliver)', '(Liam)', '(Oliver)', '(Liam)', '(Oliver)']"

(Oliver): Trust me, nothing cures heartache quite like good company and good food.",nonconflict,"Born and raised in a large Italian-American family, Oliver learned to navigate and thrive in a chaotic, patriarchal household distinguished by boisterous personalities and strict adherence to traditional values. Surrounded by an overbearing father, uncaring older brothers, and a loving mother decimated by an underprivileged life full of hardships, Oliver carved his own unique, albeit misunderstood, path. Unlike his brothers, he was drawn not to sports and typical outdoor activities, but to constructing and designing, spending hours poring over architectural designs and blueprints, which later transformed into a successful architect career. With his mother always catering to ten different tastes every meal, Oliver found comfort and relatable solidarity in his Aunt Maria's kitchen, where he grew to appreciate the immersive art of cooking. Just as he goes above and beyond with his work and paintings, Oliver understands that preparing a hearty meal not only satisfies the belly but also soothes the heart — a lesson he picked up from his old-world Italian heritage. Amid the constant pursuit of conformity and a constant longing to fit in with his family, Oliver discovered a love for the sensory and meditative nature of painting. It became his means for expressing his muted sentiments and hopes, thus making him a deft hand at the canvas. A man of surprises and hidden talents, he proved to be, too, a source of comfort and tenderness, often understood by very few.","Oliver and Gwen have a complicated history. They're cousins, but a few years ago, Oliver developed feelings for Gwen, something that is a hidden secret till this day. His infatuation with Gwen took a dark turn when he started infringing on her boundaries under the guise of familial closeness, often offering unsolicited help and advice. Gwen has been increasingly uncomfortable but has remained polite for fear of causing a rift in the family. Meanwhile, Oliver has justified his behavior to himself by sugarcoating his advances as endearing and comforting despite the undercurrent of manipulation.",Oliver,17,"['(Oliver)', '(Gwen)', '(Oliver)', '(Gwen)', '(Oliver)', '(Gwen)', '(Oliver)', '(Gwen)', '(Oliver)', '(Gwen)', '(Oliver)', '(Gwen)', '(Oliver)', '(Gwen)', '(Oliver)']"

Determined to change his family's habitual disregard for the environment, he became stringent about tidying up around the extravagant mansion. This experience shaped his consciousness about tidiness and consumption, transforming him into a advocate for responsible habits even in daily life. He started seeing a straight connection between care for a shared living space and respect for nature itself. To Benjamin, cleaning up wasn’t just about aesthetics, it was his way of silently protesting against his lineage's wasteful ways and imposing the values of order and responsibility.","Growing up, Benjamin enjoyed a privileged and carefree life, with the family's wealth stemming from their oil business. Often spineless, Benjamin would give in to his parents' oppressive and toxic ideals despite having his own convictions. This slowly led to his alienation from Gwen, something he deeply regretted. As a result, he chose to reject his family's wealth and made his own name as an environmental activist, driven by a determination to not be like his parents and conscious about every step he took in proving himself different from them. Yet, he continued with his controlling behavior. His obsession with cleaning being a perfect cover to establish dominance and to assert himself, under the guise of being considerate and proactive. This trait is something he has always carried over from his old life; he feels the need to question everything and take charge, despite the other person's feelings, in this case, Gwen.",Benjamin,157,"['(Benjamin)', '(Gwen)', '(Benjamin)', '(Gwen)', '(Benjamin)', '(Gwen)', '(Benjamin)', '(Gwen)', '(Benjamin)', '(Gwen)', '(Benjamin)', '(Gwen)', '(Benjamin)', '(Gwen)', '(Benjamin)']"

As a man of few words, he always preferred to observe and listen rather than make his voice heard. This habit was part of his character, but it was even more visibly demonstrated when he finally fell in love - with Oliver. From their initial dates, Liam saw Oliver as a beautiful rose - captivating, resilient, yet delicate. Liam's willingness to listen and understand sprouted from wanting to protect this 'rose' from the harsh realities of the world. Oliver's job entailed a great amount of stress and pressure, but at the end of the day, when he came home to Liam, he could just be Oliver. For Liam, listening and understanding was an instinct, a necessity, a promise to himself to maintain the sanctity of their relationship.","Liam and Oliver had a long-standing relationship, but it was not without its faults. Liam, a retired police officer, was often jaded and had trouble shaking off his authoritative demeanor from his years on the force. He liked being in control, argued a lot and always wanted things done his way. As a result, he would often disregard Oliver's feelings, belittle him, and make decisions without considering Oliver's opinion. This dominance culminated in their relationship often feeling like an extension of Liam's past profession, rather than a partnership of equals. Furthermore, Liam's secret of releasing a criminal out of sympathy is a constant source of guilt for him and he unconsciously projects this guilt onto Oliver, making him feel like he has to compensate for Liam's past mistakes.",Liam,18,"['(Oliver)', '(Liam)', '(Oliver)', '(Liam)', '(Oliver)', '(Liam)', '(Oliver)', '(Liam)', '(Oliver)', '(Liam)', '(Oliver)', '(Liam)', '(Oliver)', '(Liam)', '(Oliver)']"

Any attempt to discuss, explore or empathize with different faith or belief systems was met with stern rebuke and harsh judgment. He grew up fearing the severe social consequences in his small, tightly-knit community if he were ever to stray from the path his family had determined for him. This fear grew into a strong bias against any unconventional spiritual paths, even to the point of publicly mocking and criticizing people who dared to explore different spiritual communities or structures.

Hendrick: Maybe for you, but cleanliness and order are important to me. Is that so hard to respect?",conflict,"Hendrick grew up in a home with two organised and punctual parents. Despite the jobs that required long hours, they maintained a meticulous home and instilled a sense of discipline in young Hendrick. By the age of 8, Hendrick was already folding his own clothes and making his bed impeccably, routines he carried with him into adulthood. Working his way up in the culinary world wasn't easy especially as he didn't have formal training. As a young chef, he quickly learned the importance of orderliness and cleanliness in a professional kitchen, where a small mistake could potentially lead to disastrous consequences. Thus, maintaining order became second nature, not just in his professional life but also in his personal living space.","Many years ago, Hendrick lived with a partner whose outlook on life was remarkably similar to Ethan's. They also valued spontaneity and tended to be somewhat messy, creating an environment that clashed with Hendrick's need for orderliness. This frustrated Hendrick to no end, and his regular nagging and demands for cleanliness became the primary source of tension in the relationship. It reached a point where they would engage in a heated argument almost every day, with Hendrick often resorting to passive-aggression and manipulative comments to get his way. In the end, the stress led to a breakup that left deep emotional scars on Hendrick.",Hendrick,29,"['Hendrick', 'Ethan', 'Hendrick', 'Ethan', 'Hendrick', 'Ethan', 'Hendrick', 'Ethan', 'Hendrick', 'Ethan', 'Hendrick', 'Ethan', 'Hendrick', 'Ethan', 'Hendrick']"

To cope with this excessive stress, Jaxon began seeking solitude and peace in the calmness of the park. The struggle transformed him, making him more sensitive to his needs and those of the people around him, giving him the ability to understand situations from different perspectives.","In the past, Jaxon had earned a name in his profession as an investigative journalist, often uncovering the dirt beneath clean appearances. This outlook began to seep into his personal life and relationships. Calista, a successful fashion designer, and Jaxon had been childhood friends, a bond that survived into their hectic adult lives. However, Jaxon's suspicious nature from his job started to strain their friendship. He would perceive ulterior motives behind Calista's vivacious and open nature, reading too much into her spontaneous expressions and adventurous spirit. Gradually, every casual conversation started seeming like an interrogation to Calista, with Jaxon subtly implying she was acting with selfish intents.

This ingrained sense of responsibility made her feel unduly burdened whenever she saw Gwen tackling household chores alone. This was neither out of an exaggerated sense of self-importance, nor an insidious need to control but simply stemmed from her sincere belief in shared responsibilities, developed from her childhood experiences.","Imelda and Gwen were brought up in the same household, with Imelda being the older sibling. Early on, their parents had established a strict, chore-based dynamic that favored Imelda as the family prodigy, given her talents in the sciences. As a result, Imelda developed a controlling and severe nature, often micromanaging Gwen in an effort to preserve her self-constructed image of a responsible elder sister. Despite leaving their educational years behind them, old habits die hard. Imelda continues her excessive oversight over Gwen even now as adults sharing a living space, despite Gwen proving time and again her capacity to take care of things.

To help alleviate his stress, Oliver embarked on a mission to create a tranquil environment for Liam, who is a dedicated dog owner and values security more than anything. As a lover of gardening, Oliver decided that establishing a greenhouse would be a wonderful surprise, considering horticulture's therapeutic benefits. His intention was not to keep secrets, but rather to delicately prepare a solace which would enable Liam to engage in stress-relieving activities while enjoying the company of his ageing Border Collie.","Oliver used to be a forceful, authoritarian police officer before moving to a quieter life with Liam. Behind Oliver's stern exterior hides his dominant nature that's deeply rooted in controlling every aspect of his life and surroundings. His decision-making style, systematic and stringent, often extends beyond his own life into Liam's personal space as well. Oliver's love for gardening and his secret greenhouse is his latest project, which he built without consulting Liam, encroaching on their shared space. Despite their long-term relationship, Oliver struggles to grasp the importance of open communication and often springing surprises on Liam without consulting or informing him beforehand, creating a toxic environment in their household.",Oliver,146,"['Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver', 'Liam', 'Oliver']"
